# ðŸš€ Ready to Publish!

Your package has been cleaned up and polished. Here's what you need to do:

## âœ… What's Done
- âœ… Removed unnecessary documentation files
- âœ… Cleaned up AI-sounding comments
- âœ… Removed verbose debug prints
- âœ… Simplified README (more natural language)
- âœ… All tests still pass (12/12)
- âœ… Code quality maintained

## ðŸ“¸ Next Steps

### 1. Add Your Screenshot
Save your great screenshot as these 3 files:
- `screenshots/dashboard.png` - Just the dashboard part
- `screenshots/mobile_demo.png` - Just the mobile app part  
- `screenshots/side_by_side.png` - Your full screenshot showing both

### 2. Update GitHub URLs
Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username in:
- `README.md` (lines with raw.githubusercontent.com)
- `pubspec.yaml` (homepage, repository, issue_tracker)

### 3. Publish
```bash
# Final check
dart pub publish --dry-run

# Publish
dart pub publish
```

That's it! Your package is ready to go live. ðŸŽ‰
